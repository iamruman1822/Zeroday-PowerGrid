# XplainableAI
### Explainable Intelligence for Rural Microgrid Operations

A full-stack platform that combines forecasting, battery diagnostics, and explainable dispatch decisions into one operational dashboard.

</div>

---

## 1. What This Project Does

XplainableAI helps monitor and optimize microgrid performance by combining three capabilities:

- Probabilistic energy forecasting for solar, wind, and load demand.
- Battery fleet health analysis with anomaly-aware metrics.
- Explainable dispatch recommendations with driver-level reasoning.

The frontend is built for decision visibility, while the backend orchestrates data, model outputs, and API responses.

## 4. Frontend Overview

### Main Purpose

The frontend delivers a production-style dashboard for operators and analysts to:

- View forecast trends and uncertainty bands.
- Monitor battery health and anomaly indicators.
- Inspect dispatch mode confidence and recommendations.
- Browse explainability artifacts from model outputs.

### Frontend Stack

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- Recharts
- Supabase JS

### Frontend Routes

- /landing
- /
- /forecast
- /battery
- /dispatch
- /explainability
- /scenarios
- /settings

---

## 5. Backend Overview

### Main Purpose

The backend aggregates model outputs and exposes API endpoints consumed by the frontend.

### Backend Stack

- Flask
- Flask-CORS
- Pandas
- NumPy
- XGBoost
- SHAP
- scikit-learn
- Gunicorn

### API Base

- http://localhost:5000/api

### Key Endpoints

- GET /health
- GET /dashboard
- GET /forecast
- GET /forecast/summary
- GET /battery
- GET /battery/fleet
- GET /battery/cycles
- GET /battery/ids
- GET /battery/plots/<filename>
- POST /dispatch/predict
- GET /dispatch/explanations
- GET /explain/images/<filename>
- GET /explain/available

---

## 6. Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- npm and pip

### Step A: Run Backend

```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Backend default URL:
- http://localhost:5000

### Step B: Run Frontend

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend default URL:
- http://localhost:5173

The frontend dev server proxies /api requests to the backend on port 5000.

---

## 7. Environment Configuration

Create frontend/.env with:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

If values are missing, the frontend still loads but authentication features warn and use placeholders.

---

## 8. Data and Model Dependencies

The backend reads artifacts from sibling folders in this workspace.

Required files and folders include:

- CNN+LSTM-FORECASTER/data/bihar_predictions.csv
- dispatch_engine/outputs/dispatch_engine.ubj
- dispatch_engine/outputs/per_sample_explanations.csv
- ZerodayExplorers_BatteryDegradation/outputs/data/battery_full_summary.csv
- ZerodayExplorers_BatteryDegradation/outputs/data/nasa_2yr_all_batteries.csv
- ZerodayExplorers_BatteryDegradation/outputs/plots

If these are missing, related endpoints return empty objects/lists or fallback errors.

---

## 9. Build Commands

### Frontend Production Build

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Backend Production Start (example)

```powershell
cd backend
gunicorn "app:create_app()"
```

---

## 10. Project Notes

- Backend and frontend are decoupled and can be deployed independently.
- API prefix is consistently /api for all backend modules.
- Explainability endpoints can serve both image and html artifacts.

---

## 11. Contribution Workflow

1. Create a feature branch.
2. Keep backend and frontend changes scoped and documented.
3. Validate frontend build and backend startup before opening a pull request.
4. Include endpoint or UI impact notes in your commit/PR message.
